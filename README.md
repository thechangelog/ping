# Ping the Changelog

This repository serves as our open contact form. [Ask us anything](https://github.com/thechangelog/ping/issues/new) -- or share your projects, news, or feedback. If you'd like to pitch us on a post you've written, [use our Draft repo](https://github.com/thechangelog/draft) - it's [pretty active](https://github.com/thechangelog/draft/graphs/contributors).

### Get in touch

Getting in touch is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/thechangelog/ping/issues/new).

We'll try to answer you as soon as we can get to it. Once we've answered, we'll close the issue just so we know what we've covered, but don't worry -- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. Feel free to comment on any of the older issues too, even if you didn't create it.

### Browse previous conversations

[Check out the closed issues filter](https://github.com/thechangelog/ping/issues?sort=created&directionÞsc&state=closed&page=1) to browse previous conversations we've had. We try to use this as an email replacement everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.
